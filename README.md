# poc-dnft-svg
A case for using SVG to achieve dynamic NFTs. 

Here we will prove the concept of using SVG technology to generate dynamic NFTs on Ethereum.

On the first interactions we will generate a dynamic SVG image as an NFT with 4 layers.
In the first layer, the root image of the NFT will be used. Using 1/4 of the final image.
For the other 3 layers, extra properties or metadata will be used, in order to point to 3 different sources of images.
Allowing the NFT holder to set three assets, which will be 3 separated layers over the root NFT Animation URL.
The Base NFT Image will be used as the base SVG Layer and will be immutable
